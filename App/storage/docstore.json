However, you may stillproceed with the Leave of Absence request to preserve your place in your current degree program.Processing Your RequestISS reviews the application, advises you of the immigration implications and submits the application to the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar willdecide if your Leave of Absence can be approved. If you have registered for classes for the semester during which you will be on a leave, you must drop your classes.  Remember: Approval for a Leave of Absence does not mean that your classes are automatically dropped.  If you do not drop your classes before the\u201clast day to drop without \ufb01nancial penalty\u201d , you will be required to pay any tuition or fees that you owe.

SEVIS termination means that you are no longer in F-1 status andcannot use your UB I-20 to re-enter the U.S. until you complete the process to return from a leave of absence.However, if you are transferring to another U.S. school and have submitted a SEVIS transfer request, or have a Medical Reduced Course Load approval,you are eligible to maintain F-1 status.

Once your e-form and allsupporting documentation is submitted, ISS will review your situation to determine if you are eligible for a SEVIS re-activation or if an initial I-20 isrequired.

It also resets the F-1eligibility \"clock\" which means that you must complete one full year (two full academic semesters) before you are eligible for Curricular PracticalTraining or Optional Practical Training.If you have a valid F-1 visa stamp in your passport, you may be able to use that stamp to re-enter the United States.

The primarypurpose of CPT is to gain practical experience in the student's \ufb01eld of study. The training experience must be an integral part of an establishedcurriculum and directly related to the student's major area of study.Since CPT is curricular in nature, the student must also enroll for a course that requires an off-campus training experience. CPT is not possible for all F-1students because it is dependent on the academic requirements of a speci\ufb01c academic program.Please note that \u201cemployment\u201d is de\ufb01ned as any type of service for which a bene\ufb01t, including academic credit, is received.  Therefore, even if thestudent will not be paid for the internship, they should obtain CPT authorization.Eligibility RequirementsTo be eligible for CPT authorization you must meet the following requirements:\u2022You are currently in F-1 status and maintaining status.\u2022You have been enrolled full-time for at least one academic year (two semesters) in your current \ufb01eld of study/major.\u2022Students who changed degree levels at UB or transferred from another U.S. college/university may be eligible for CPT after one semester at UB.Please contact ISS to determine eligibility. \u2022An exception to this requirement is given to graduate students whose academic program requires immediate participation in an off-campusinternship or \ufb01eld placement.Not Sure Which Type of WorkAuthorization is Best?Read our information comparingcommon F-1 o!-campusemployment authorizations todetermine which is mostappropriate for your situation. \ue90c\nNEW CPT Application ProcessStarting for Winter & Spring 2024, we have a new CPT e-form process.Faculty & Sta! can read about their part of the process on our Faculty/Sta!

Refer to the chart below (under CPT ApplicationDeadlines) when choosing your start and end dates.\u2022If granted CPT and additional time is needed, then a new CPT application, including course enrollment for the next semester is required.\u2022For summer CPT, it is important to consider the start and end date of the summer course used to qualify for CPT.\u2022If CPT authorization was granted in your \ufb01nal semester and you were also approved for a Final Semester Reduced Course Load in that semester,then your CPT cannot be extended into a future semester.\u2022ISS will not approve an I-20 Extension if the only reason for the extension is a non-required CPT. TIP: We often see students with job offers that end prior to the semester end date, which then later gets extended. In general, we recommend that yourequest the full length of the CPT semester.Example for a Spring 2023 CPT: \u2022Your job offer is from 1/25/2023 - 4/21/2023.\u2022We recommend you request CPT authorization from 1/25/2023 - 5/20/2023.Requesting an extension to your CPT after it has already started requires a separate process and could take up to two weeks for ISS to authorize.

Remember, CPT must be an \u201cintegral part of an establishedcurriculum\u201d .  You are not eligible for CPT if you have completed all degree requirements.\u2022If your CPT credits do not count towards degree requirements, we recommend re-considering your CPT request. CPT must be integral to thecurriculum. It is more difficult to argue that an experience is integral if the credits do not count towards completion of the degree. Students shouldalso consider potential negative immigration consequences to excessive CPT use. USCIS is questioning OPT and H1B applications when a studenthas repeatedly used CPT.  Lastly, ISS is concerned about a student's ability to make \u201cnormal progress\u201d towards completing degree requirements ifyou cannot graduate on time due to extra internships. This could impact eligibility for an I-20 extension.

However, keep in mind that USCIS processing times can vary; average processing times aregenerally 3 months. The dates of any full-time Pre-Completion OPT must align with a semester since ISS must con\ufb01rm that you meet one of the requirements above*.For example, if you want a full-time summer Pre-OPT, your start date must be after the Spring semester ends. The end date must be before theFall semester begins.*PhD students interested in Pre-Completion OPT should consult with ISS.How does Pre-Completion OPT impact Post-Completion OPT?Any full-time Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training authorization you receive is subtracted from your total 12-month period. \u2022Ex. A student who is authorized for 3 months of full-time Pre-Completion OPT during the summer will have only 9 months of OPT remaining.Any part-time OPT (20 hours per week or less) is deducted at the rate of one day of practical training for every two part-time days of OPTauthorized. \u2022Ex. A student who is authorized for 4 months of part-time Pre-Completion OPT during the semester will have 10 months of full-time OPTremaining.When should I apply for Pre-Completion OPT?The earliest you can apply is 90 days before your chosen work start date.You may submit your application up to 90 days prior to completing one academic year of study, provided that the period of employment will notbegin until the completion of the full academic year.\nStep 1 is applying for an OPT I-20 from ISSPrepare your OPT application and submit it online to ISS following the directions below:1.

Since OPT is apersonal application, it is your choice which method you use.

It is important to understand that the USCIS H-1B registration process happens before the H-1B application is actually \ufb01led.  To qualify for the OPTCap Gap Extension your H-1B must have been chosen in the registration process AND the employer must have submitted the Form I-129 to USCIS.  TheI-129 and supporting documents must be RECIEVED by USCIS before the expiration of the OPT/STEM EAD (to qualify for an extension of workauthorization) or before the end of the 60-day grace period (to qualify for an extension of stay). Additional F-1 Cap Gap Extension information can be found on the USCIS website.

However, processing times vary widely, depending on the time of year andworkload at the Service Center to which you send your application. We encourage you to regularly review the processing times found on the USCISwebsite.If you have a job offer and 120 days has passed since the Receipt Date on your I797 Receipt Notice, you may contact us for assistance. We caninquire with USCIS about the status of your application. However, we cannot guarantee that our inquiry will result in an expedite or change inprocessing times.Once you have waited 150 days, or beyond the current maximum published USCIS processing times, we recommend that you take the followingactions:\u2022Email ISS with a copy of your receipt notice and a description of the actions you have already taken (any communication with USCIS, forexample).

Please refer to USCIS's premiumprocessing page for details on cost, eligibility, and timing.If you do not request premium processing USCIS expedite criteria are very strict and it can be difficult to provide sufficient evidence. Having a joboffer or the possibility of losing that job do not generally qualify for an expedite unless you can effectively make an argument that your situationdoes meet the criteria. If considering an expedite, please ensure that you have sufficient documentation and a compelling argument.Additional information on expedite criteria and how to \ufb01le can be found on the USCIS page. Can I work with a pending OPT STEM Extension application?

You may begin full-time study only after your change of status to F-1 is approved by the USCIS or after you re-enter the U.S. in F-1 status, if changing status via travel.\u2022You must be admitted to a degree program at UB. If you are currently enrolled at UB, you must intend to maintain full-time enrollment at UB in thefuture.\u2022You must receive an I-20 from UB.  \"Initial\" I-20's are issued when you intend to depart the U.S. and apply for a F-1 visa.Obtaining an I-20If you are applying for admission to UB and requesting to change your change of status via travel prior to the start of your \ufb01rst semester, then the Officeof International Admissions will issue your I-20. As a part of the admissions process, you will receive instructions explaining which documents you needto provide in order to receive an I-20.If you are already admitted to UB and are currently enrolled as a student, ISS will need the following to issue an \"initial\" I-20:\u2022Copies of your current valid immigration documents (Passport, Visa Stamp/I-797 Approval Notice, I-94, etc.)\u2022Financial documents indicating you have sufficient funds for your studies.

Change of Status via Travel Process1. Obtain an \u201cInitial\u201d I-20.  While you are applying to UB or working with an International Student Advisor in ISS, please indicate that you plan tochange your status by traveling.  2. Pay the SEVIS Fee.  Visit our SEVIS fee page for information.  You must bring the SEVIS fee payment receipt with you to the U.S. Consulate whenyou apply for an F-1 visa.3. Prepare your F-1 visa application materials.  Visit our U.S. Visa page for more information. \u2022Canadian Citizens are not required to apply for an F-1 visa stamp.4. After receiving your F-1 visa stamp, re-enter the U.S. using the I-20 and F-1 visa stamp. 5. Submit copies of your F-1 Visa and I-94 to ISS upon your arrival. This is extremely important because without con\ufb01rmation that you were successfulin changing your status, ISS cannot activate your SEVIS record.6. As an F-1 student, you must understand how to maintain your status. You will be required to watch an F-1 Immigration Session online.

These options should be discussed with an International Student Advisor in detail.OverviewF-1 students who have failed to maintain their immigration status may request reinstatement from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services(USCIS), in certain situations.   There are positives and negatives to \ufb01ling a reinstatement application with the USCIS, so it is best to discuss yoursituation with both an immigration attorney and an International Student Advisor.If an attorney advises a student to request reinstatement from the USCIS, an International Student Advisor (DSO) will provide a list of documents toprepare. After reviewing your documentation, a DSO will make a determination on your eligibility based on the circumstances of your case. Ifdeemed eligible, the DSO will create a new I-20 requesting \"reinstatement\". A copy of this I-20 must be mailed to the USCIS, along with the otherrequired materials. Additional information on how to \ufb01le a reinstatement application will be provided after an International Student Advisordetermines that reinstatement is possible.Eligibility RequirementsThe USCIS will evaluate F-1 reinstatement applicants on the following criteria:  \u2022The violation of status was due to circumstances beyond the student's control OR the violation relates to a reduction in your course load thatwould have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve the reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to thestudent. \u2022Some examples of \"circumstances beyond the student's control\" might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a naturaldisaster or inadvertence, oversight or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of violations or wherea willful failure on the student's part resulted in the need for reinstatement.   \u2022The applicant must not have a record of repeated or willful violations of USCIS regulations\u2022The applicant is currently pursuing a full-time course of study\u2022The applicant must not have engaged in unauthorized employment\u2022The applicant has not been out-of-status for more than 5 months at the time of \ufb01ling the request for reinstatement.Important Considerations\u2022Processing times at the USCIS vary greatly. 3-12 months (sometimes longer) is common. The cost of an I-539 reinstatement application is $390.\u2022After \ufb01ling for reinstatement, students must maintain their F-1 status, which includes enrolling full-time.\u2022While the application is pending, students may not travel outside the U.S. If they do, the USCIS will consider the application to be abandonedand the application will be denied.\u2022Students with a pending reinstatement may not work on campus and are not eligible for any practical training.

Toaccomplish this, you will need a new \u201cinitial\u201d I-20. Once a new I-20 is issued, you must:\u2022Pay the SEVIS Fee\u2022Depart the U.S.\u2022Re-enter the U.S. using a valid F-1 visaA re-entry to the U.S. after a status violation is viewed as an initial entry to the U.S. As such, you are bound by restrictions placed on new students,such as the requirement that you wait a full academic year (2 semesters) before you are eligible for practical training (CPT, OPT).\nTo request a new I-20 for travel and reentry:Schedule an appointment with an International Student Advisor to discuss your situation. Submit the required documentation to request an \u201cinitial\u201dI-20:\u2022New \ufb01nancial documents showing one full year of funding (or less if you will graduate in one semester).\u2022Copy of your \ufb02ight itinerary indicating your date of departure from the U.S.\u2022Your home country address reported to the HUB Student Center\ue616.Travel and Reentry vs. ReinstatementBoth Reinstatement and Travel and Re-entry involve risks. If your application for reinstatement is denied, you will be required to depart the U.S.immediately. However, students who are reinstated by the USCIS continue in their previous F-1 status. Reinstatement applications can also take a longtime to receive a decision (3-12+ months) and on-campus employment is not possible while awaiting a decision.If you choose travel and re-entry and are denied re-entry at the border, you may be required to return home. Students who choose travel and re-enterare also considered initial status students and must complete one academic year before they are eligible to apply for off-campusemployment (Optional Practical Training or Curricular Practical Training). However, travel and re-entry can be a quick process \u2013 depending on theavailability of \ufb02ights and availability of visa appointments.

Admission to a new schoolalone does not automatically allow an F-1 student to begin studies at another school. A SEVIS Transfer, if eligible, has several bene\ufb01ts:\u2022You do not pay the SEVIS I-901 fee again\u2022You can remain in the U.S. in between programs (if there is less than 5 months between the end of your current program and the start of your newprogram, more details below.)\u2022You maintain the same SEVIS ID number \u2022If your F-1 visa is still valid, you can continue to use it until its expiration date.  It is OK if your old school's name is on your visa.\u2022You may travel in between programs and are not subject to the 30-day entry restriction (entering no earlier than 30 days before your programstarts).A SEVIS transfer is recommended in the following situations:\u2022If you graduate from a U.S. high school and plan to study at UB (Transfer IN) .\u2022If you are a current student at another U.S. school and plan to continue studies at UB (Transfer IN)\u2022If you are a current UB student and plan to continue studies at another U.S. school (Transfer OUT)\u2022Former UB students currently on Optional Practical Training (Post-Completion, STEM or Cap Gap) who plan to resume studies at another U.S.school. (Transfer OUT)Eligibility Requirements\u2022You must be maintaining F-1 status\u2022You must have an offer of admission from a new school\u2022If you already graduated or completed OPT, you must request the SEVIS transfer within your 60-day grace periodIf you are a UB student who has a valid UB I-20 and you will continue studies in a new degree program at UB, a SEVIS transfer is not needed.Instead, you should be issued a \"Change of Education Level\" I-20 after your admission is !nalized and you have provided the necessarydocuments.
